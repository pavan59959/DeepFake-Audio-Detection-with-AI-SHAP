# ‚ù§Ô∏èDeepfake Audio Detector with AI SHPA

### üòäProject Overview
This project is dedicated to addressing the issue of detecting deepfake audio by leveraging sophisticated neural network architectures like VGG16, MobileNet, ResNet, and custom CNNs. Employed GANs for audio content synthesis. By integrating explainable AI (AI) SHPA methodologies such as LIME, Grad-CAM, and SHAP, the project aims to not only improve detection accuracy but also offer meaningful insights into the model's predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training our deepfake audio detection models is the 'Fake or Real' dataset, created by researchers from York University. This dataset consists of authentic and deepfake audio recordings that have been used to train our models to distinguish between real and fake samples effectively.

For enhanced model performance, the audio files were converted into spectrograms. Spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound or other signal as they vary with time, which provides a more informative feature set for deep learning models.

## Streamlit Web Application

This project includes a Streamlit web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the deepfake audio detection models. Below is a preview of the application in action.
